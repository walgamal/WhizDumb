# WhizDumb

WhizDumb is a React-powered trivia game that brings the excitement of multiplayer trivia challenges to your fingertips. Utilizing [Open Trivia Databases's Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) for dynamically sourced questions, players can engage in endless rounds of brain-teasing fun across various categories. Designed and developed from scratch, this project showcases my expertise in frontend development using React, along with proficiency in HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design principles. With its sleek interface implemented entirely with plain CSS, WhizDumb offers an immersive gaming experience for players of all levels.

What sets WhizDumb apart is its couch multiplayer feature, allowing friends to gather around a single screen and compete in real-time, fostering lively interactions and friendly rivalries. This project truly showcases how I transformed design concepts into a fully functional application, demonstrating my passion for crafting engaging web experiences.

**Side Note**: All progress on this project was tracked in the form of tasks in Azure DevOps. I found ADO to be a very useful tool for developement, especially it's kanban board features and git/repo support.
